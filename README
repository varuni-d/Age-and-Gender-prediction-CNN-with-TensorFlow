Age and Gender predicting using Deep Learning

Dataset

The IMDB-Wiki dataset will be utilized to make age and gender predictions.

Download the IMDB dataset:
curl https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/static/imdb_crop.tar -o <output file path>

Similarly, obtain the Wiki dataset. These folders containing unput images will be read by the img_preprocess.py program.

img_preprocess.py: Read images, preprocess as input for the convolutional neural network (CNN).
age_model.py, gender_model.py: Apply CNN to compute age (as regression) and gender (as classification), repectively.
multitask_cnn.py: Apply multi-task CNN model to obtain above results.
